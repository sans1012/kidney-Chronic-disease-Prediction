# kidney-Chronic-disease-Prediction
This is a Machine Learning project using Classification Use Case


**STEPS USED**

###### Data Cleaning for Preprocessing Analysis
  -   Renaming the columns heads using data description.txt
  -   Converting Object to Numerical Columns
  -   Extracting Numerical and Categorical Columns
  -   Checking for Dirtyness in data
  
###### Finding Columns Correlation and impact on features
  -   Ploting a heatmap and finding the best correlation
  -   Finding relationships between Data variables
  
###### Automate the analysis for
  -   Plots- scatter, violin, kdeplot

###### Preform Exploratory Data Anlysis and Build a model to predict- **If a preson has a chronic kidney disease or not**
  -   Finding and filling the missing values
  -   Feature Encoding techniques to find the the important features
  -   Selecting important features
  
###### Finding the best model for the purpose
  -   XGB Classifier- XGBost Algorithm
  -   RandomizedSearchCV
  -   Cross validate the model and find accuracy
